    <h1>Best practices for indexing an un-indexed location</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Get Outside uses services provided by Google Maps to retrieve information
      about and validate the information you provided about a location.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to help you help us with finding locations, use the following
      steps to get the most accurate information about a location.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, open Google Maps. If you don't have it installed, you can visit
      <a href="https://maps.google.com" target="_blank"
        >Google Maps from within your browser (click here to go to Google Maps -
        opens in new tab)</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>When opened, you should see a screen like this:</p>
    <img class="tutorial-image" src="../../assets/img/start.png" />
    <br id="list" />
    <p>
      From here, you can do one of two things to find the details of the
      location you want to add:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="#pins"
          >Move around the map and tap on pins to reveal details</a
        >
      </li>
      <li><a href="#bar">Use the search bar</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Click the links to go to that section of this document.</p>
    <h1 id="pins">Pins on the Map</h1>
    <details>
      <summary>Click here to see details</summary>
      <p>
        <a href="#list">Back to list</a>&emsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Zoom further into the map to give you more margin of error when
          tapping on the pins
        </li>
        <li>Tap and drag to move the focus to different places on the map.</li>
        <li>Tap on a pin to view more information about the location.</li>
        <li>
          Take note of the name of the location (the first words that appear at
          the top of the pop-up), as this is what will be needed for the
          "Business Name" line in app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scroll down and copy the address, as this will be useful for filling
          in the rest of the information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return to Get Outside and use the information you have found to fill
          in the location lookup forum
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The full workflow should look a little like this:</p>

    <!--<details>-->
    <summary>Click here to see details</summary>
    <p><a href="#list">Back to list</a>&emsp;<a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Move the map focus to the general place where the location you want to
        add is
      </li>
      <li>Tap the search bar at the top of the screen</li>
      <li>
        Use one of the following methods to find the location you want to add
      </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Add the business name, followed by the town/city it's in</li>
        <li>Enter the address or post code that you want to search</li>
        <li>Use the general business name, without the city after the name.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Take note of the 'title', which is the business name</li>
      <li>
        Scroll down and copy the address, as this will be useful for filling in
        the rest of the information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return to Get Outside and use the information you have found to fill in
        the location lookup forum
      </li>
    </ol>
